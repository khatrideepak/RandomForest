Requirements:
Python 3.4.3 64bits
This program is built on Python 3.4 with Spyder App (Anaconda IDE).


How to run to program:
Simply run the program in Python 3.4, no inputs required.


About the Program:

This program doesn't take any command line inputs. I thought to keep it as simple as possible, while providing the robust functionality of RandomForest Classifier. This program build 10 decision tree models to use as a ensemble in RandomForest classifer. The program is tested with all 3 datasets provided. The accuracy of the classifier is almost same (sometimes a bit high, sometimes a bit low) as we obtain from the Weka toolkit.
